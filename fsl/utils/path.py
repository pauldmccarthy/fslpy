    containing the paths to all other files in the group (including the
    ``path`` itself).

    If the ``path`` does not appear to be part of a file group, or appears to
    be part of an incomplete file group, a list containing only the ``path``
    is returned.

    If the ``path`` does not exist, or appears to be part of more than one
    file group, a :exc:`PathError` is raised.

    File groups can be used to specify a collection of file suffixes which
    should always exist alongside each other. This can be used to resolve
    ambiguity when multiple files exist with the same ``prefix`` and supported
    extensions (e.g. ``file.hdr`` and ``file.img``). The file groups are
    specified as a list of sequences, for example::

        [('.img',    '.hdr'),
         ('.img.gz', '.hdr.gz')]

    If you specify ``fileGroups=[('.img', '.hdr')]`` and ``prefix='file'``, and
    both ``file.img`` and ``file.hdr`` exist, the :func:`addExt` function would
    return ``file.img`` (i.e. the file which matches the first extension in
    the group).

    Similarly, if you call the :func:`.imcp.imcp` or :func:`.imcp.immv`
    functions with the above parameters, both ``file.img`` and ``file.hdr``
    will be moved.

    .. note:: The primary use-case of file groups is to resolve ambiguity with
              respect to NIFTI and ANALYSE75 image pairs. By specifying
              ``fileGroups=[('.img', '.hdr'), ('.img.gz', '.hdr.gz')]``, the
              :func:`addExt`, :func:`.imcp.immv` and :func:`.imcp.imcp`
              functions are able to figure out what you mean when you specify
              ``file``, and both ``file.hdr`` and ``file.img`` (or
              ``file.hdr.gz`` and ``file.img.gz``) exist.

                      the ``path``) are returned. Otherwise, only the file
                      extensions in the group are returned.

    :arg unambiguous: Defaults to ``False``. If ``True``, and the path
                      is not unambiguously part of one group, or part of
                      no groups, a :exc:`PathError` is raised.
