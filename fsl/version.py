"""The primary purpose of this module is as a container for the ``fslpy``
version number. A handful of convenience functions for managing version
numbers are also defined here.

.. autosummary::
   :nosignatures:

   __version__
   parseVersionString
   compareVersions
   patchVersion


The ``fslpy`` version number consists of three numbers, separated by a period,
roughly obeys the Semantic Versioning conventions (http://semver.org/), and
is compatible with PEP 440 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/):


 1. The major release number. This gets updated for major/external releases.

 2. The minor release number. This gets updated for minor/internal releases,
    which involve new features, bug-fixes, and other updates.

 3. The point release number. This gets updated for minor/internal releases,
    which primarily involve bug-fixes and minor changes.


The sole exceptions to the above convention are:

  - development versions, where the point release number is followed by a
    development release identifier of the form ``'.devN'``, where ``N``
    denotes a specific development release.

  - Builds, where the version number ends in ``'+buildN'``, where ``N``
    denotes a specific build.
