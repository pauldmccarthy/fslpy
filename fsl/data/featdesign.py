# featdesign.py - The FEATFSFDesign class, and a few other things.

"""This module provides the :class:`FEATFSFDesign` class, which encapsulates
a FEAT design matrix.


The :class:`FEATFSFDesign` class is intended to be used to access the design
matrix for a FEAT analysis. The main reason for using the ``FEATFSFDesign``
class, instead of just using the design matrix loaded directly from the
``[analysis].feat/design.mat`` file, is because FEAT supports voxelwise EVs,
where the contents of the design matrix will differ for each voxel in the
analysis. For all voxelwise EVs (confound or otherwise), the design matrix (in
``design.mat``) contains a dummy column which contains the mean across all
voxels.  The :meth:`FEATFSFDesign.getDesign` method will return an
appropriate design matrix for a specific voxel.


.. note:: Interaction EVs are not currently supported.


Explanatory variables in a FEAT design
--------------------------------------


A FEAT design matrix may contain the following types of explanatory variables:

 - *Normal* EVs. This is simply a column in the design matrix, defined by the
   user.

 - *Temporal derivative* of normal EVs. A column in the design matrix
   containing the derivative of a normal EV. The presence of a temporal
   derivative EV for a given normal EV can be determined by the ``deriv_yn``
   flag in the ``design.fsf`` file.

 - *Basis function* EV. One or more columns derived from a normal EV. A normal
   EV with the ``convolve`` value set to ``4``, ``5``, or ``6`` will be
   followed by a set of basis function EVs (the number of additional EVs can
   be determined by the ``basisfnum`` flag).

 - *Voxelwise* EVs. An EV with different values for each voxel. An EV with the
   ``shape`` value set to ``9`` is a voxelwise EV. The voxel data will be
   stored in a file in the FEAT directory called ``designVoxelwiseEVN.nii.gz``
   (where ``N`` is the EV number, relative to the order in which the EVs were
   set up by the user).

A FEAT design matrix will contain EVs of the above types, followed by the
following types of *confound* EVs:

 - *Voxelwise confound* EVs. These are confound EVs with different values for
   each voxel. If the design matrix contains confound EVs, two additional
   files will be present in the FEAT directory, ``vef.dat`` and
   ``ven.dat``. The ``vef.dat`` file contains a list of comma separated file
   names, which are paths to the confound images (these should be in the FEAT
   directory, and called ``InputConfoundEVN.nii.gz``). ``ven.dat`` is a list
   of comma separated integers, specifying the column number (starting from 1)
   of each voxelwise confound EV in the final design matrix.

 - *Motion parameter* EVs. The user can choose to add 6 or 24 motion
   parameters as regressors to the design matrix. If the ``motionevs`` value
   in ``design.fsf`` is set to ``1``, then 6 motion EVs are added; if
   ``motionevs`` is ``2``, then 24 motion EVs are added.

 - *Confound* EVs. These are any other EVs added by the user.


Module contents
---------------


In addition to the :class:`FEATFSFDesign` class, this module contains a few
other functions and classes that may be useful to advanced users.


The :func:`loadDesignMat` function loads the ``design.mat`` file from a
FEAT directory, and returns it as a numpy array.


The following functions, defined in this module, will analyse a FEAT analysis
to determine the contents of its design matrix (these functions are called by
the :meth:`FEATFSFDesign.__init__` method, but may be called directly):

.. autosummary::
   :nosignatures:

   getFirstLevelEVs
   getHigherLevelEVs


These functions return a list containing one instance of the following classes
for each column in the design matrix:

.. autosummary::
   :nosignatures:

   NormalEV
   TemporalDerivativeEV
   BasisFunctionEV
   VoxelwiseEV
   ConfoundEV
   MotionParameterEV
   VoxelwiseConfoundEV
